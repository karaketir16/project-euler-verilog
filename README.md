# Project Euler Solutions in Verilog  

This repository contains solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems implemented in Verilog. Each solution is designed to be **synthesizable** and is currently tested using simulation.  

## Why Verilog?  
As a computer engineer learning digital design, I wanted a fun and practical way to deepen my knowledge of Verilog. Solving mathematical problems like those in Project Euler provides an interesting challenge to implement and optimize algorithms in hardware description language.

## Features  
- **Synthesizable Code**: Each solution is written with the goal of being synthesizable for real-world hardware implementations.  
- **Simulations**: Currently, the solutions are tested through simulations to verify correctness and functionality.
